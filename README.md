# PE_Parser
A simple PE parser written in C++. Note that some parts of the code needs C++20, so you should compile the code with the correct options. For example to compile the code with gcc or g++, add the `-stdlib=c++20` option.

# Warning
The code isn't still compeleted and just the following parts of a PE get parsed:
- DOS Header
- DOS Stub
- NT Headers
